# pytorch-mnist-fcnet
A fully connected neural network (MLP) built from scratch in PyTorch to classify MNIST handwritten digits. Includes dataset preprocessing, model architecture, training loop, loss visualization, and accuracy evaluation.
 The pipeline includes:

Data loading & preprocessing (tensor conversion + normalization)

Fully-connected (Dense) neural network

Training using Adam & Cross-Entropy loss

Loss curve visualization

Accuracy evaluation on the test set
